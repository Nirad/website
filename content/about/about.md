title: About the Project
---

OrionUO is an Open Source Ultima Online&reg; client, written from scratch for `Windows` by [Hotride](https://github.com/hotride) and ported to `Linux` and `MacOSX` by [fungos](https://github.com/fungos). The project is currently maintained by fungos and [Deuce](https://github.com/jokker23).

The project aims to have a fully open Ultima Online&reg; client compatible with different eras from the game.

The Orion Suite is composed of the game client, the game launcher and updater and (for the foreseeable future) a closed source scriptable game assistant similar to Razor Assitant.
